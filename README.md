## About This Repo
- This GitHub repo aims to provide **honest**, **anonymous** reviews on MSCSE courses/professors, from Santa Clara University's graduate students. The purpose of this repo is to offer new/current graduate students (all major backgrounds, including non-CS) guidance on course enrollment and give prospective students insights into SCU's MSCSE program. If you think this repo is helpful, you may add this repo to your bookmark and **star this repo (click star on upper right corner)**.
- This is a WIP repo: the information listed below don't cover all courses, and there may be inaccuracies. If the courses you have attended are not listed, you are welcomed to share your opinions and insights with us! You can create a **new Issue** in this repo, titled [course number, professor], and your review should include four parts: [Course workload and difficulty, Grading (if it's curved, how much), professor review, and whether it is recommended]. You can also send an email to [scucourseeval@gmail.com](mailto:scucourseeval@gmail.com) to contact the author. You can either send your review in text, or via a scheduled zoom meeting. All reviews will be posted **anonymously**.
- Thanks to all the friends who provided contents for or shared this Repo!


## Disclaimer
- The author is not affiliated to any on-campus student organization/non-profit organization/profit-making company/religious group. During the making of the repo, the author did not collaborate with any parties other than SCU's student body.
- All the evaluations compiled by the author do not make any remarks on **the school itself**, but only evaluate whether the **course is suitable for students who are also actively looking for jobs**.
- Keep in mind that information in this repo is time-sensitive. We do not ruled out the possibility that there will be subsequent adjustments to the scoring standards (become stricter/looser) on the courses/professors. This repo only collects informaiton from students starting after 22falls, so please take the timeliness into your mind.
- People have different backgrounds, knowledge, experiences, and learning abilities. Therefore, it is impossible to make an evaluation that is completely impartial and specific to each student's situation. You still need to make choices based on your actual situation when deciding which courses to enroll. Everyone is only responsible for their own choices.


## Must-knows of Course Enrollment on eCampus
- The time of course enrollment for the next quarter is usually the fifth week of the current quarter (first batch) and the first two weeks after the start of the quarter (second batch). Each student will be assigned a fixed interval for their first batch enrollment (the system will send an email notification). Generally, seats of popular courses would be filled early during first batch enrollment, so you need to pay special attention to your assigned enrollment time.
> __Note__ Assigned enrollment time: old students > new students. The more credits you have taken as an SCU student, the earlier your assigned enrollment time. However, according to anonymous reports from multiple students, given the same credits, the assigned enrollment time will be arranged in alphabetical order according to name order. The official announcement is that students are randomly assigned in a tie situation.
- ${\color{red}$50\ Drop/Swap\ Penalty}$: It is free to drop/swap courses from the first batch enrollment to one week before first day of class (quarter start). After that, each course drop/swap costs an additional ${\color{red}$50}$: https://www.scu.edu/engineering/graduate/academic-calendar/. **This only applies to graduate engineering students.**
- ${\color{red}Deadline}$: You may receive a **100%** refund if you drop a class **before the Sunday of the first week of class**, only **50%** before **the Sunday of the second week**, and only **25%** in the third week.
- The default max credits units a student can enroll each quarter is **10 credit units**, which is equivalent to two 4-credits classes + one 2-credits class. If you need to enroll more than 10 units, you need to consult your assigned academic advisor in advance, fill in the overload form and submit it to the peer advisor: https://www.scu.edu/engineering/current-student-resources/current-graduate-students/forms /. **New students cannot apply for overload for their first quarter of study**
- You can view course information on CourseAvail https://www.scu.edu/apps/courseavail/?p=schedule and enroll on eCampus -> SCU Manage Class

- F1 students need to enroll at least 8 credits per quarter to maintain F1 status, and at most one course (2 credits or 4 credits) out of the 8 credits can be a purely online courses
- SCU CPT Policy: If F-1 students need to apply for CPT for summer internship/part-time job, they must enroll in ENGR 288/289, a 1-credit course, and meet the school's requirements:
   https://www.scu.edu/engineering/academic-programs/department-of-computer-engineering/coen-student-policies/
   - ENGR 288 requires students to have taken 16 credit units to enroll (Non-transfer SCU credit units), ENGR 289 requires 24 credit units

## PoS form - for new students
During the first quarter, you need to submit a Program of Study form to COEN Peer Advisor - Michael. You can use this form to plan out which courses to take for your MSCSE program, and which foundation courses you can waive as well. If the POS form is not submitted by the end of your first quarter, the school would place a hold on your course enrollment of next quarter (you couldn't enroll in any courses).
- For students coming from non-CS background, you're required to take 7 foundation courses, which are divided into two categories:
   1. Three courses not counting towards graduation requirements: you have to spend extra money (assembly, logic design, and basic data structure)
   2. Four courses (discrete mathematics, probability theory, linear algebra, advanced programming) can be counted towards graduation requirements, but if you have similar courses on your undergraduate transcript, they will be waived and you can't enroll into those courses in SCU. In addition, for the logic design course (921C: Introduction to Logic Design) in category (i), if you fail to waive it, **you can only take it at SCU**. Assembly and data structures can be studied at a designated community college, or you can enroll them at SCU. **The trouble is that not only will you have to spend extra tuition on foundation courses, but you may also risk that it will be difficult to get a passing grade. Some friends with non-CS background studied hard, but they took the assembly class of 920C and got below C.**
- **How to waive Foundation Courses**: If there are courses with similar names on the transcript, you can send the course syllabus to Michael, and finally Michael and your advisor will jointly decide whether you can waive it. However, most students from non-CS backgrounds haven't taken assembly language and logic design courses in their undergrad studies, **920c and 921c are basically unable to be waived**. You can try to talk the academic advisor in a face-to-face zoom meeting to increase your chances of waive these two courses. There're two waiver options: 1) you can do an in-person quiz in front of Michael, or 2) contact professors of these two courses, only take the final exam, and get a C or above.
- **I can't waive these classes, what should I do?**:
   1. **If you do not believe in your self-learning ability, do not enroll in these two courses in your first quarter of study**: assembly and logic are more difficult for students coming from non-CS background, and the instructors of these two courses are not very good at lecturing the course materials. According to the students' feedback, the exams of these two courses have different contents from the ppt used in the teaching of these courses.
   2. **Enroll in similar courses in local Community College**: Consult peer advisor for a list of designated community colleges in which you may take similar courses to waive taking them at SCU.

## Part 0. Evaluation Criteria
- Baseline Standard: People who are under pressure to find a job/internship should have different course plannings from those who got an internship/full-time offer.
- To be specific, students under pressure to find job are more suitable to take [reasonable grading] [moderate difficulty] classes. This is not only because they have to spend time preparing for job interviews (especially students w/ non-CS background), but also because your are more likely to encounter a professor who has stricter grading standards in more difficult courses (prone to give C- grades / corresponding to GPA 1.7), **For international students, low grades will result in difficulties of enrolling into CPT courses.** If you've secured a job already, you may choose courses based on your interests in the CS field, which usually have more workload than the aforementioned lightweight courses.
- Therefore, each evaluation consists of the following four parts:
   - Workload and difficulty
   - Grading Criteria & Grading Histories
   - Evaluation on Professor
   - Recommend this course?


## Part 1. Foundation Courses: COEN 912/920C/921C (for students w/ non-CS backgrounds)
- These three courses don't count towards the 46 credit units of graduation requirements. You can waive these three courses 1) if you can show you've taken similar courses in your undergrad transcript, or 2) take simlar courses in approved local community colleges. If you failed to waive them, you have to take them at SCU and pay extra tuition.
- If you decide to take them at SCU, the instructor of these three courses is the same professor: C. Fussell
- ${\color{red}You\ are\ asked\ to\ complete\ these\ three\ foundation\ courses\ within\ the\ first\ three\ quarter\ of\ study,\ but\ some\ of\ them\ are\ not\ offered\ each\ quarter}$


### COEN920C Embedded Systems and Assembly Language
- **Workload and Difficulty:** The homework does not need to be submitted, but it needs to be practiced. You must be proficient in doing the questions, otherwise the exam will be too late according to the cheatsheet.
- **Grading Criteria & Grading Histories:** It is purely composed of exams, twice quiz30%, midterm30%, final40%. Midterm took a lot of array index questions, and this part of the content was only started after midterm, which can be described as unprepared. The final also took a lot of content in the last two chapters, but the teacher only spent a week to go through it briefly, and there were many question types that had never been seen in homework. Although you can bring a cheatsheet, but due to the large amount of questions, it will be time-consuming to check, causing many people to overturn in this class. Keeping the average score every time can probably keep the B, and each time it is only one or two points lower than the average. All possible to C. The homework question type can only keep the B grade, and there will be some exam questions that have not been seen before. ** Even a grade of D will be given. **
- **Evaluation on Professor:** The quality of teaching is worrying, purely reading ppt and the tone is hypnotic. There will be a zoom review after the exam, but no solution. You can send emails to ask questions, and you can zoom, but there is no office hour.
- **Recommend this course?** A classmate who has attended said: "[Regardless of whether there is a job offer] there is no reason to choose this course and 912/921. It is recommended to try various ways to Waive, or go to de anza for online classes. The author added: If you feel that you still need to study this knowledge, it is also recommended that you try not to choose in the first quarter, and you can choose after you adapt to the learning rhythm of the school for a period of time.

## Part 2. COEN Core Courses
- Core Courses of most students: 279 (Algorithm), 283 (Operating System), 210 (Computer Architecture). It is said that very few students in CS majors also have these three courses being Waived, so they can only choose the Advanced version of these three courses (279->**3**79, 283->**3**83,...).
- For these three core courses, there are usually 1-3 professors in each quarter to provide courses at the same time. Since the arrangement of teaching teachers is different every year, the author here can only summarize all the teachers who have taught each course, and cannot provide relevant information [which semester the teacher will definitely teach].

### 2.1 COEN279 Design & Analysis of Algorithms
The following professors are currently known to have attended: (incomplete list)
- Professor 1: N. Tran
   - **Workload and difficulty:** In terms of Workload, there are homework every week, with 2-3 questions for each homework, and it takes half a day to a day of research to ensure the correct rate. There are 2 exams (mid-term + final), the amount of questions is large, handwritten code is required and CheatSheet is not allowed. In terms of difficulty, before the midterm exam, it was more like a math proof course than an algorithm, and the question types of the exam and homework were closer. After the midterm exam, many difficult algorithms will be involved. The final exam generally reflects that it is very difficult, and you need to tear up DP, NP-Hard proof and other questions by hand within two hours.
   - **Grading Criteria & Grading Histories:** Exams account for a huge proportion, 80% in total, and even if there are 8 homeworks, they only account for 20% in total. Therefore, test performance plays an absolutely decisive role in GPA. According to the situation of the previous session and this session, even if the average score of each homework and test is basically above, it may be given a B-. If there is a test below the average score, it will basically be C and below. If each test and assignment is more than the average score, it is basically an A. Grader is very strict on the first three assignments. According to the practical experience of the students around me, half of the marks may be deducted even if a summary conclusion or a formula in the middle of the derivation process is missing in the first three assignments.
   - **Evaluation on Professor:** will give a sample test before the exam. If you have any questions, you can also go to the office hour to communicate and answer questions. However, if it involves questions such as whether XXX will be tested in the exam, it will not give a positive answer, which is not conducive to reviewing and preparing for the exam.
   - **Recommend this course?** It has high requirements for algorithms and mathematical foundations. If you have not systematically studied data structures and various common algorithm knowledge in college, it is not recommended to choose it during job hunting. If you want to deepen your understanding of the algorithm on the basis of the university's algorithm and **don't care about giving points**, or if you already have a stable offer and want to further improve yourself, it is recommended to choose.

- Professor 2: Y. Wang
   - **Workload and Difficulty:** According to the students who have passed, the homework exams are basically Leetcode questions. contrast with other teachers.
   - **Grading Criteria & Grading Histories:** According to the students who have attended the class, the writing on the blackboard is very serious and clear, and the DP/NP-hard proof questions will be explained step by step.
   - **Evaluation on Professor:** If you can choose it, it is highly recommended to choose it during job hunting. (One of the pitfalls of **SCU course selection** is: for freshmen, the priority of course selection is lower than that of old students, which also leads to the fact that when it is the turn of freshmen to choose courses, they usually cannot choose Prof Wang's courses. If you can't choose In his case, it is recommended to consider Zaky or Nath.)

- Professor 3: A. Zaky
   - **Workload and Difficulty:** Moderate workload and moderate difficulty. As long as you are not completely paddling, listen to the lectures a little more carefully in class, write your homework well, and the exam is not difficult. You can carry a cheat sheet.
   - **Grading Criteria & Grading Histories:** The grader scores very well. As long as the homework is handed in and done seriously, there is a high probability that it will get a full score. In addition to homework and the end of the midterm, there are additional Bonus. If you want to get Bonus, you can pass attendance (the class will roll your name) and do additional small homework (run the program, for example, let you use 100 1000 10000 data to test quick sort and select sort which is faster) and other methods. If the Bonus can get some points, the total score can be upgraded by one grade, such as B+ to A-, and the students who pass the Bonus upgrade will not affect the overall score distribution. Most of the students around me got A- or A.
   - **Evaluation on Professor:** A teacher who is willing to communicate, is serious about teaching, and tries to teach you. He himself said that it doesn't matter if you make a mistake, and the hard work is the scoring criterion.
   - **Recommend this course?** It is recommended that students with weak foundations choose Zaky.

- Professor 4: S. Nath (new teacher starting in Fall 2022)
   - **Workload and Difficulty:** The amount of homework is relatively large. According to the students who have attended the class, each homework basically takes half a day to a day. There are 2 group work projects, and each time you need to form a team with different students. You can carry a cheat sheet for the midterm exam. The final exam is divided into an online exam (6-8 hours) and a closed-book exam (2 hours). It is difficult and very exhausting after the exam.
   - **Grading Criteria & Grading Histories:** Although the difficulty is high, the scoring is loose. Most people got close to full marks in the online exam, and 43% of the people got A in the final overall evaluation.
   - **Evaluation on Professor:** He is willing to communicate and friendly, and tries his best to remember the students' faces and names. It is said that he will invite students to form a group to go to the pub to drink together.
   - **Recommend this course?** If you arrange time to complete the homework carefully while looking for a job, even if you fail to rank in the top 50%, the final score will most likely not affect the CPT. From the point of view of giving points, it is recommended to choose compared to Tran. But if you have certain concerns about the difficulty, Zaky is more recommended.

### 2.2 COEN283 Operating Systems
The following professors are currently known to have attended: (incomplete list)
- Professor 1: A. Elkady
   - **Workload and Difficulty:** There are assignments, projects and midterm and final exams. The overall amount is relatively small, but the exam and homework are more difficult, and there are many conceptual questions. Cheat Sheets are not allowed in the exam. If you only rely on pre-examination raids, you may not be able to cover all the review points. If you choose a good team for the project, it is not difficult for students with certain programming skills.
   - **Grading Criteria & Grading Histories:** The score is loose. According to the students who have passed the test, even if you only get 50 points in the final exam, you can get a B and you can curve. If you do your homework and projects well, your final score will not be too bad.
   - **Recommend this course?** The students who have attended said that Prof Elkady is more recommended than Prof MH Wang.

- Professor 2: M.H. Wang
   - **Workload and Difficulty:** From the perspective of workload, it is considered large for non-CS background students. The two programming assignments this semester are required to be completed in C language, which is really a headache for students who don't know it. The exam is more difficult, and the paper must be written. Whether it is the pa or the paper, there are many details, and it takes time and effort to complete.
   - **Grading Criteria & Grading Histories:** Mid-term average score of 30%. Fortunately, everyone was satisfied with the final grade, because he said that the average final grade was A- in the first class.
   - **Evaluation on Professor:** Usually, the speaking speed in class is slow, and the teacher is also enthusiastic about answering questions.
   - **Recommend this course?** It is not recommended for students who are under pressure to find a job, because it takes too much time. It is suitable for students who want to learn the underlying principles, have average job hunting pressure, and have high demands on themselves.


### 2.3 COEN210 Computer Architecture
The following professors are currently known to have attended:
- Professor 1: Y. Cui (new teacher starting in Fall 2022)
   - **Workload and Difficulty:** 5% of the three assignments are all topics in the textbook: 15% for a project. According to some students, the layout and presentation of the project are poor. The content is roughly to design a cpu, need to submit assembly code and datapath, and finally there is presentation and report; two quiz10%, half an hour, relatively few questions; midterm30%, there are optional fill-in-the-blank answers, the amount of questions is relatively large but there is an exam scope; final40%, fill in the blanks without choice, answer about 10 questions, and give detailed review points. You can bring a cheat sheet.
   - **Grading Criteria & Grading Histories:** Although the questions are difficult, the scoring is very loose. The assignments are basically full marks, and the proportion of the final total score of A is much higher than that of Professor K Pahlavan's 210.
   - **Evaluation on Professor:** Prioritize the key points before the exam and inform the scope of the exam, which is very helpful for review. Doing well in the cheet cheet exam should be no problem. Although the class is basically reading in front of the ppt, the attitude of answering questions is very good and friendly, and you can also ask questions directly in Chinese.
   - **Recommend this course?** Recommended compared to Prof Pahlavan.

- Professor 2: K. Pahlavan (new teacher starting in Fall 2022)
   - **Workload and Difficulty:** There are 6 assignments in total, choose 3 submissions, each assignment will take at least half a day, and you need to consult extracurricular materials. A total of 3 quizs and a final, no CheatSheet is allowed, and the exams are all closed-book. Usually quiz concept questions are mostly simple questions, so they must be filled. 60% of the finals are multiple choices, and the short-answer questions have fewer human points, and a lot of chapter 6 content that was not mentioned in the end was inspected. Even the top students said that the final performance was not good. It is not recommended to spend too much energy on projects that account for 20%, and the final scores are almost the same, and there is no bonus. And because the ppt of this class is too bad, it is best to go to class, it is easy to get lost when studying alone at home.
   - **Grading Criteria & Grading Histories:** Usually 3 quizs account for 30% of the total, and final accounts for 40%. Therefore, the performance of the test plays an absolutely decisive role in GPA. I learned that the scores ranged from C to A-. Even the top student failed to get an A. The main reason was that the final test had a lot of homework and content that was not in the PPT. It was generally reported that the teacher gave a very low score. **According to the reflections of students, even if you do your homework seriously and take the exam seriously, you may get a C.**
   - **Evaluation on Professor:** There is no sample test, and there is no key point. You can only rely on the students to study the books by themselves. During the class, the students ask questions and basically will not give clear answers.
   - **Recommend this course?** The students who have attended the course, regardless of whether they are majors or not, all agree that they do not recommend it. Even students from majors said it was difficult to review and prepare for the exam.

## Part 3. COEN 3XX Courses (courses whose numbers start with 3)
### COEN317 Distributed Systems
- Professor 1: R. Moazzeni
     - **Workload and Difficulty:** Workload is undoubtedly large. A classmate once commented: "I have never seen this kind of homework, programming homework, and mid-term and end-of-term projects in SCU. , Report and Presentation classes." In terms of difficulty, because the subject of distributed systems is inherently difficult and has a lot of knowledge points, the consistent feeling of this course for students regardless of subject or non-subject is the content of the class, homework Proj, There is almost no relationship between the three exams. The mid-term and final exams are online, and the Lockdown Browser is used for assessment. The exam consists of multiple choice questions and short answer questions, covering a lot of knowledge points.
     - **Grading Criteria & Grading Histories:** The score is relatively loose, and if the homework can be done, it will probably be given full marks. Exam short answer questions will try to give points. The author scored 43 in the midterm (average score of about 70) and 80+ in the end of the semester. The homework Proj basically got a full score, and finally got a B. Most of the students who scored around 70% in the midterm exam got B+ or above.
     - **Evaluation on Professor:** In terms of communication with students, if students have questions, they are willing to discuss and reply to emails very quickly. The evaluation of the lectures is quite polarized. Some students think that the professor is only reading PPT in class and the structure of the PPT is confusing, while the other part of the students think that the explanation of the concepts is very clear.
     - **Recommend this course?** If you are looking for a job, it is not recommended to choose, it will take a lot of time. If you have an offer or want to deepen your understanding of distributed systems (after all, knowing something about distributed systems is beneficial to practical work), it is recommended to choose. If you have already decided to choose this course, it is recommended to study and review in groups, as it is difficult to handle by yourself. Adding PA to the resume is not very effective. If the Final Project can be made and placed on the resume, it may be a plus point.
- Professor 2: R. Bruce (new lecturer starting for Spring 2023, no comments yet)

### COEN359 Design Patterns (not every semester)
Professor: R. Mikkilineni
   - **Workload and Difficulty:** Full online teaching, load According to the students who took this course, the whole learning time only took about a week, and the final exam was also Online. A small project needs to be done in the middle, and there is basically no homework other than that.
   - **Grading Criteria & Grading Histories:** Homework is basically given close to full marks, other TBD
   - **Evaluation on Professor:** RMP is basically full of praise.
   - **Recommend this course?** Recommended, especially if you have a certain Java foundation, it is relatively easy to learn.


## Part 4. COEN 2XX Courses Other Electives
### COEN233 Computer Networks
====To Be Updated====

### COEN290 Computer Graphics
Professor: Y. Wang
   - **Workload and Difficulty:** There are homework, Project and Final Exam. The project needs to be completed with Python and third-party libraries. The homework and Final Exam are difficult. If students who have no prior knowledge of computer graphics choose directly, it may be a bit painful to get started.
   - **Recommend this course?** Needless to say, Prof. Wang, if you can choose it, recommend it.

### COEN241 Cloud Computing
Professor: S. Choi
   - **Workload and Difficulty:** There are homework, Project and Midterm. Project is related to cloud computing, and the general content is to deploy a project/website using Docker and cloud servers. If you have full stack project experience before, you can apply it to the project.
   - **Grading Criteria & Grading Histories:** It is more strict, but it will not be suspended. For 22fall, only 25% of the students got grade A, 70% of the students won’t get grade A even if the total score reaches 90, only grade B, and the remaining 5% are said to be graded C after the curve released the water.
   - **Evaluation on Professor:** Difficult to communicate, students who got a B and a total score of 90 or more tried to Argue the final score, but were rejected by him on the grounds that he had already curve/released water.
   - **Recommend this course?** It is not recommended for students who have high GPA requirements or students who need to increase their GPA through elective courses.

## Part 5. COEN Teacher/Lecturer General Evaluation (Authored by a non-CS background classmate)
### Lightning Protection
If you don’t want to affect your GPA or CPT, and you don’t want to learn mental issues, please try to avoid choosing the key period for these professors’ courses:
- N. Tran: For people with a good foundation in mathematics and science, it is generally considered difficult to learn, let alone non-CS rookies who want to find a job? An Indian girl I know (in a major class) and I are classmates. Both of us studied hard and did our homework as hard as possible, but we didn't get an average score in the exam, and we only got a C. Another classmate who got an average score in the midterm exam also only got a B-. **If someone recommends Tran, it should be because the recommended person has a good algorithm foundation and is willing to learn new knowledge. **
- R. Bruce: One of the professors of the 317 Distributed System, in the first class, he said that he was very strict with the branch, and also said the following "classic quotes": ** "I am very strict with the branch, because life is This is the case. You will do the same when you enter the company in the future, so there is nothing wrong with experiencing it in advance.” ** At the end of the semester, there are basically only 3 or 4 students left.
- K. Pahlavan: Out of focus. If the foundation is not good before the final review, it is easy to get lost. Moreover, there was no curve in the 22 fall semester, which caused **some students who come from non-CS backgrounds seriously studied and got C**.
- A. Elkady: According to the friends who have attended the class, if students want to get grades at the end of the semester, they need to give him a good review on RateMyProfessor, **Take screenshots for grades**. A friend complained that this can be reported to the school, but I don’t know why no one has reported it. The score is unknown.
- S. Jahangiri: According to a friend who has taken the COEN380 Advanced Database Systems class, the programming project may require students to explain the code line by line. **If you can’t explain it or it’s vague, he will silently give you an F** in his heart and think that you copied the code,** and he will really give you an F at the end of the semester and report it to the school. He also said that no matter whether you are an F1 student or an international student or looking for a job, you can only listen to his ** in his class (probably meaning).

(PS: The situation of other professors is still being updated. These are the reasons why the professors who are 100% recommended to avoid for non-CS background students do not recommend a certain course here: Even for them, everyone has no requirements for courses. I also don’t want to make irresponsible recommendations, but the point of lightning protection is generally recognized, so I only mentioned teachers who try to avoid)
